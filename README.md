# Python-File-Organizer
Python Script to move files based on their extension(s)

The script is very generic and lacks a lot of features and has little to no error checking in place. I am simply creating a repository for it for fun, and who knows...maybe in time it'll be more useful, I hope I do to.

As for now however, please do comment and point out some problems. I am a noob and am wishing to make progress through mistakes.

Thank You,
Kaizen.
